 # Photogallery app made with React, Cloudinary and Sweetalert :computer:	:rocket:

This is a photogallery app to that lets you upload photos to a Cloudinary account and also throws error and confirmation messages using Sweetalert. Was great because helped to use Hooks such as useContext, useState and useEffect, and also uses the FileReader web API, styled with Flexbox for page layout
